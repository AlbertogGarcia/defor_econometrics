# Abstract {-}
Conservation practitioners need rigorous evidence measuring the effectiveness of proposed policy interventions. Increasingly, scientists are generating this evidence by applying methods of impact evaluation to remotely sensed data on land use change, however, these applications come with new challenges. Using Monte Carlo simulations and analytical proofs, we demonstrate that many of the models employed for conservation impact evaluation are biased - the significance, magnitude and even direction of estimated effects from many studies may be incorrect. These errors threaten to undermine the evidence base that is increasingly used to inform conservation policy adoption and design. We review this burgeoning literature and develop practical guidance for the design of econometric models quantifying conservation policy effectiveness. 

# Introduction
The founding goal of conservation biology was to provide principles and tools to preserve biological diversity [@soule1985]. To live up to this goal, scientists must generate causal evidence detailing the effectiveness of  conservation interventions [@williams2020]. Such evidence is critical for practitioners who grapple with challenging questions of cause and effect. Do marine protected areas stop unsustainable harvesting of fish? Can payments for ecosystem services encourage lasting reforestation? When successful, conservation science provides answers that improve the way society confronts environmental challenges. However, inappropriate methods can yield misleading conclusions and, as a result, risk diverting scarce financial and political resources from the most effective conservation strategies.

Increasingly, conservation science has turned to econometric methods of impact evaluation to disentangle causal relationships [@butsic2017; @baylis2016]. These methods generate accurate estimates of an intervention's impact by comparing observed outcomes to a rigorous counterfactual of what would have happened in the absence of an intervention [@ferraro2009; @meyfroidt2016; @ferraro2019; @ribas2020]. Conservation impact evaluation increasingly makes use of panel data in which units are observed repeatedly through time, thanks, in large part, to the proliferation of remote sensing [@blackman2013; @jones2015]. For example, NASA's landsat missions provide detailed and consistent information on land use spanning the entirety of the world since the 1970s [@hansen2012]. As a result, a scientist hoping to quantify the impacts of a land use policy adopted decades ago can assemble data for treated and control units that span both pre- and post-implementation periods [@jain2020]. New sensors and methods allow for similar time series tracking changes in air pollution, fires, or animal movement [e.g., @remelgado2018; @fezizadeh2013]. 

However, many of these remotely sensed metrics have structural differences from the data used in more traditional applications of causal inference. These differences include the underlying error structure of generated data products and unique properties of the ecological processes being studied, both of which are especially relevant in the land-use change context. Observed land-use change outcomes are often irreversible in the short term; i.e. the replacement of native grasslands with a housing development. This is particularly true for deforestation events, after which the regrowth of forest to a detectable level is generally not within a relevant time frame. Some researchers have taken steps to account for this property of deforestation processes. We show that ignoring this aspect of land-use change processes as well as adopting commonly used panel adjustments can result in erroneous estimates. 

Most econometric impact evaluations to date use the unit of analysis provided by the data. We argue that researchers should think about the actual process by which land-use change occurs, considering factors that may impact outcome heterogeneity in a given setting. The pixel is the unit of analysis at which researchers access data, however, if property ownership is a strong determinant of heterogeneity, a pixel level analysis may be atheoretical in relation to the true land-use change process. This type of decision has known implicaions for bias, raising the question of how to select the proper unit of analysis in a given setting [@avelino2016]. Of particular interest is when these processes operate in conjuction with one another at multiple scales. 

We demonstrate that, as a result of the differences inherent to satellite data in the land-use change context, many of the econometric models used in this growing literature are likely biased - significance, magnitude and even direction of estimated effects might be incorrect. These biases arise even when researchers follow common guidance to adopt "rigorous" research designs with valid counterfactuals [@blackman2013; @jones2015]. Based on a review of the existing literature, we identify key model design decisions that researchers need to make. Using analytical proofs and Monte Carlo simulations, we show how these design decisions affect the validity of causal inference in these settings. Lastly, we illustrate ways in which scientists can tailor these design decisions to minimize bias and better understand the implications of their impact evaluations.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews panel econometric methods in the land-use impact evaluation literature. Section 3 reviews common model parameterization decisions that researchers face in the design of their impact evaluation. Section 4 describes our Monte Carlo simulation approach to exploring the performance of various model parameterizations. Section 5 presents results from analytical proofs and Monte Carlo simulations that show certain model parameterizations are biased and lead to improper inference. Section 6 concludes and offers guidance for researchers' impact evaluations.



# Panel methods in the impact evaluation literature

While randomized experiments are the gold standard for scientific discovery in both the natural and social sciences [@edwards2020; @jayachandran2017], conservation often poses questions that are prohibitively expensive, unethical or impossible to pursue through experimentation. In such settings, a growing portfolio of statistical techniques enable researchers to draw causal conclusions using observational data [@larsen2019]. Importantly, these methods account for the non-random assignment of interventions that often confound identification of causal relationships; a low rate of deforestation within a remote protected area may reflect the protected area's effectiveness, or it may be indicative of the remote location's poor suitability for agricultural development [@andam2008; @pfaff2009]. A diversity of research designs such as regression discontinuity, synthetic control, matching, instrumental variables and event studies have been used to generate statistical counterfactuals of conservation interventions [@butsic2017]. These approaches frequently build upon panel data settings in which units are observed repeatedly through time, enabling researchers to observe changes in outcomes after the adoption of an intervention [@blackman2013]. When a rigorous research design is applied to panel data, observational studies can yield conclusions that are comparable to what a researcher would discover if they were able to run a randomized experiment [@ferraro2017].

The remainder of our paper focuses on two methods commonly used in panel settings to measure the impact of conservation interventions: Difference-in-Differences (DID) and Two-way Fixed Effects (TWFE) regression models [@blackman2013; @jones2015]. The typical DID regression model includes a dummy variable equal to one for units in the treatment group, a dummy variable equal to one for observations in the period after the intervention, and their interaction. Conceptually, the DID estimator calculates the treatment effect as the difference between the differences of the treated and untreated observations before and after treatment [@butsic2017]. The DID estimator identifies the ATT under one main assumption, known as the common trends assumption. It amounts to assuming that both units in the intervention area and untreated units would have experienced the same average change in the outcome (trend) in the absence of the intervention. While fundamentally untestable, ensuring that deforestation rates in the intervention area and the control area followed parallel trajectories prior to the date of the intervention can give creedence to this assumption [@butsic2017].

We center our attention on the case in which a researcher would like to quantify the impact of a policy intervention on deforestation rates. We assume that the intervention has clearly defined boundaries (e.g., a protected area, certified concession, or indigenous territory), and that the researcher has access to spatially explicit observations of forest cover and forest loss spanning the periods before and after the intervention was adopted. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that, for every treated unit, we fail to observe the value that the outcome would have taken in the absence of treatment [@holland1986]. Figure 1 displays this problem in the context of our simulated conservation intervention --- the landscape is depicted as observed by the researcher at the end of the observation period, including the unobservable counterfactual of what would have happened if the conservation intervention had not been adopted. Note that in untreated areas, there is no counterfactual deforestation, since no intervention ever took place. The researcher's goal is to measure the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated $(ATT)$, which quantifies the avoided deforestation occurring inside treated units. This general setting describes a broad array of research studies that apply panel methods to remotely sensed data (Table 1). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.pos = 'H', fig.cap="This figure shows deforestation that would have ocurred in the absence of the conservation intervention at the same point in time, after implementation of the conservation intervention. Note that no counterfactual deforestation occurs in the control area, since no intervention ocurred.", fig.show='hold'}

```

<!-- In figure legend, change blue and green to "pixels not deforested in intervention area/ in untreated area over the course of the observation period" -->

Figure 2 displays intuition behind the DID estimator in the context of our simulated conservation intervention --- Panel A depicts the deforestation in the landscape as observed by the researcher in the first versus second periods, while Panel B depicts how the DID estimator is found, given the deforestation rate trends in the intervention and untreated areas along with the unobservable counterfactual of what would have happened if the conservation intervention had not been adopted.

TWFE regression models are often used to apply DID methods to multiple groups or treatment periods. This amounts to estimating a regression that controls for unit and time fixed effects. Intuitively, this can be thought of as including a dummy variable for each unit of analysis and each time period. The fixed effects account for any unobservable confounding variables that may vary across units or through time. When the treatment effect is constant across groups and over time, TWFE regressions
estimate the $ATT$ under the standard common trends assumption [@deChaisemartin2019]. Because TWFE regression models are often used to generalize the DID method, they are used in a wider variety of settings. Settings in which units undergo treatment in more than two distinct time periods may be amenable to TWFE regression, but not the standard DID method. For example, a researcher may use an TWFE regression model to examine the effectiveness of a network of protected areas, where the protected areas where created at different times or a payment for ecosystem services (PES) program, which enrolls properties in annual cohorts. In the case of two groups and two time periods, the TWFE regression should give an estimate equivalent to that of the DID model [@wooldridge]. This flexibility has led to TWFE regression models becoming commonplace in the literature. 

## Key regression specification decisions in the literature

<!-- Kelsey: this section feels a little ad hoc. maybe describe how the literature guided choice of where to focus?  -->

Several key decisions must be made by the researcher in the design of the econometric model for causal inference. A literature review led us to three major model specification decisions in which the same choice was not consistently applied. These were the choice between DID and TWFE models, the unit of analysis, and functional form. A more in depth discussion of these model decisions and authors' common justifications can be found in the Appendix. As seen in Table 1, a wide variety of model parameterizations are used in the literature, and some of these may be biased estimators of the treatment effect. Little guidance currently exists for researchers to make these specification decisions, and many common choices are likely to result in severe bias and improper inference. 

Researchers must decide on the unit of analysis for their econometric model, which comes with several implications both for the interpretation of results and consideration of spatial autocorrelation. Analyses using a binary pixel or plot are standard in the literature [@jones2015], but authors have used multiple areal units including larger grids or irregular polygons based on administrative boundaries. A pixel or grid cell (e.g., pixels aggregated to a 5kmx5km grid) level analysis may be preferable in contexts where there is no clear alternative unit of interest, however, the pixel is often times used without any explanation for why it is preferred to alternative options. This paper explores some of the potential pitfalls of using the pixel as opposed to an aggregated unit of analysis such as a grid cell or administrative unit. 

Other papers in the literature choose to conduct analysis at the level of the property or comparable decision making unit. This level of analysis matches the scale at which management decisions often occur [@carlson2018], and has been promoted in the context of PES programs that enroll at the property level. Using the entire area owned by an individual landowner or a larger administrative unit such as the county provides the advantage of accounting for spillover effects that occur when the intervention spurs deforestation on other parts of the relevant unit [@blackman2018; @alix-garcia2014; @arriagada2012]. We consider how aggregation may impact researchers' analyses in the presence and absence of property level unobservables.  

The decision of functional form is another often overlooked decison, particularly with a binary measure of forest cover. The vast majority of papers use OLS, maintaining a linear functional form. Few authors explain their reasoning for choosing the preferred functional form of the econometric model. This choice may have an impact on the resulting analysis, particularly in low and high deforestation settings. We evaluate the performance of linear, logit, probit, and poisson models in our setting to see the impact of alternative functional form choices.

# Methods

We employ a series of Monte Carlo simulations alongside analytical proofs in order to evaluate the benefits and pitfalls of different econometric model specifications. Monte Carlo simulations allow us to (1) generate synthetic landscapes with known policy effectiveness and (2) analyze the performance of econometric models in estimating the policy's known impact. Doing so provides additional support for our analytical results as well as evidence of the tradeoffs made when using different models. Our general findings include the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In the case of an pixelated (binary) forest cover outcome, observations must be dropped in the periods after a pixel first becomes deforested. This is shown via analytical proof and Monte Carlo simulations. 
\item Pixel level TWFE regression models with a binary forest cover outcome do not identify the $ATT$, but in fact, identify a simple post-treatment difference in outcomes ($ATT$ plus the pre-treatment difference in outcomes). This is shown via analytical proof and Monte Carlo simulations.
\item Property-level unobservables negatively impact model bias, coverage, and RMSE when the unit of analysis is too large or too small relative to the true decision-making unit. This is shown via Monte Carlo simulations.
\item Choice of model functional form may play a larger role in particularly high and low deforestation settings. This is shown via Monte Carlo simulations.
\end{enumerate}

## Monte Carlo simulations
Our landscape consists of administrative units that are either untreated $(D=0)$ or are assigned to a conservation treatment $(D=1)$. We observe deforestation in two, even-length periods, a pre-treatment $(t < t_{0})$ and a post-treatment $(t \ge t_{0})$ period. 

The data generating process underlying our Monte Carlo simulations begins with the assignment of five parameters: The mean, pre-treatment period deforestation rate for untreated units, $baseline_0$; the mean, pre-treatment period deforestation rate for treated units, $baseline_1$; untreated units' mean change in deforestation rates occurring between the pre- and post-treatment periods, $trend_0$; treated units' mean counterfactual change in deforestation rates occurring between the pre- and post-treatment periods in the absence of treatment, $trend_1$; and lastly, the average treatment effect of the policy on the treated units, $ATT$. The researcher's primary goal is to estimate ATT. In all of our simulations, we impose parallel trends (i.e. set $trend_0 = trend_1$). 

<!-- We define the five parameters as follows: -->

<!-- \begin{align*} -->
<!-- baseline_0 &= E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=0]\\ -->
<!-- baseline_1 &= E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=1]\\ -->
<!-- trend_0 &= E[y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0] - E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=0]\\ -->
<!-- trend_1 &= E[y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1] - E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=1]\\ -->
<!-- ATT &= E[y_{it}(1) - y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1]\\ -->
<!-- \end{align*} -->

Rather than directly observing deforestation rates across the landscape in each time period, the researcher observes annualized maps depicting pixel-level, binary deforestation $(y_{ivt}\ \epsilon \ 0, 1)$. We follow [@kerr; @pfaff2004] and model these binary deforestation events as a function of each pixel's unobservable value along a continuous, latent variable $(y^*_{ivt})$ indicating the utility of deforesting pixel $i$, in property $v$, in year $t$. We define this latent variable as:

$$y^*_{ivt} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathbbm{1}\{  D_i = 1  \} +$$ 
$$\beta_{2,0} \mathbbm{1}\{  t \geq t_0  \} (1 - \mathbbm{1}\{  D_i = 1  \})+\beta_{2,1} \mathbbm{1}\{  t \geq t_0  \} \mathbbm{1}\{  D_i = 1  \} +$$
$$\beta_3 \mathbbm{1}\{  D_i = 1  \} \mathbbm{1}\{  t \geq t_0  \} +$$ $$\alpha_i + u_{it} + \rho_{v}$$

The $\beta$ coefficients dictate how the utility of deforestation evolves over the two time periods $(\mathbbm{1}\{  t \geq t_0  \})$, across the control and treated units $(\mathbbm{1}\{  D_i = 1  \})$. These coefficients can be defined as a transformation of the five parameters assigned by the researcher ($baseline_0$, $baseline_1$, $trend_0$, $trend_1$, $ATT$; derivation provided in Appendix). In addition, we assume that the value of deforestation is influenced by time-invariant random disturbances at the scale of individual pixels ($\alpha_i \sim N(0, \sigma_a^2)$) or properties ($\rho_v \sim N(0, \sigma_p^2)$), as well as time-varying, pixel-scale disturbances ($u_{it} \sim N(0, \sigma_u^2)$). These disturbances can represent a variety of spatial and temporal processes including, for example, the biophysical characteristics of a location, or the preferences of a property owner. 

We assume that pixels with a positive utility of deforestation are cleared, resulting in the following mapping from the latent $y^*_{ivt}$ to the observed $y_{ivt}$ variable:
\begin{align}
 y_{ivt} = \begin{cases} 
      1 & y^*_{ivt} > 0  \\
      0 & otherwise
   \end{cases}
\end{align}

Here, the observed outcome variable, $y_{ivt}$, is equal to 1 if pixel $i$ in property $v$ is observed as deforested in time $t$ and 0 otherwise. The observed variable is the binary outcome visible to the researcher, which represents the result of a more complex data generating process that reflects the pre-defined effectiveness of the policy $(ATT)$, temporal trends in deforestation $(trend_0$ and $trend_1)$, and pre-treatment deforestation probabilities $(baseline_0$ and $baseline_1)$. Also included are unobservable, pixel-specific $(\alpha_i)$ and property-specific $(\rho_v)$ determinants of deforestation, as well as time-varying, pixel-level disturbances $(u_{ivt})$. Figure 3 demonstrates that DID estimates are unbiased using our DGP allowing the outcome variable $y_{ivt}$ to vary between 0 and 1 across periods.

## Set up and evaluation
<!-- 1 percent, or 1 percentage point? -->
It is not uncommon to see annual treatment effects amounting to less than a 1 percentage point reduction in the annual deforestation rate [e.g. @robalino2013; @jones2017]. These modest reductions in the annual deforestation rate, however, can amount to large effects over the course of the study period. For example, @alix-garcia2018 find that environmental land registration in Brazil’s Amazonian states of Mato Grosso and Para reduced the annual deforestation rate by an average 0.5 percentage points, which has  amounted to an overall deforestation reduction of 10\%. We have parameterized a guiding example, representative of an impactful intervention, to explore for the remainder of the paper. 

The initial simulated landscape has the following characteristics: a pre-treatment deforestation rate of 2\% in the control area ($baseline_0 = 0.02$); a pre-treatment deforestation rate of 5\% in the intervention area ($baseline_1 = 0.05$); a decrease in the deforestation rate of .5 percentage points between the first and second period in the absence of treatment ($trend_0 = trend_1 = -0.005$); and an average reduction of 1 percentage point in the deforestation rate in treated units due to the intervention ($ATT = -0.01$). Lastly, we assign $\sigma_a = .25$, $\sigma_p = 0$, and $\sigma_u = .1$ to begin.


We use three primary criteria to compare econometric models: bias, RMSE, and coverage probability of their estimate of the $ATT$ parameter. Using our Monte Carlo simulations, we determine bias by computing the difference between each model's mean estimate of the ATT and the known $ATT$ parameter. RMSE addresses the distribution of the estimates around the true $ATT$. Coverage probability is defined as the proportion of simulations in which the true $ATT$ lies within the simulation's 95\% confidence interval (CI). As such, we would expect the $ATT$ to lie within this CI 95\% of the time, however, factors such as the bias of the estimates, their distribution, and treatment of standard errors may impact coverage. If the estimator is biased, for example, it is ex-ante less likely that the true parameter falls within the CI. We largely rely on the bias of the estimators to evaluate their performance, but RMSE and coverage probability play an important role when bias is comparable across estimators. 

# Results

## Using a pixelated forest cover outcome

Analyses at the pixel level are prevalent in the literature, as seen in Table 1. Further, it has often been promoted as the preferred unit of analysis in many cases. Deforested pixels generally do not revert back to forest cover over the course of the study period. To account for irreversibilities in this land-use change process, it has been advised to drop deforested pixels in the periods after they first become deforested [@jones2015; @alix-garcia2017]. Keeping the deforested pixel in the panel beyond the first period in which it was observed as deforested may imply that it has actively been deforested in each subsequent time period, when in fact, no new deforestation event has ocurred. These pixels, therefore, contribute unwarrantedly toward the deforestation rate in each additional period they are left in the panel. We show both analytically and with our Monte Carlo simulations that pixel level regression models failing to drop deforested pixels in subsequent periods do indeed incur severe bias (Appendix 7.2). 

## Issue using TWFE with binary outcome

Despite widespread use of pixel level analyses, they are problematic in the context of TWFE regression models. In fact, the TWFE model yields the post-treatment difference in outcomes (single difference), rather than the desired ATT. We provide two forms of evidence to support this claim: (1) evidence from our Monte Carlo simulations and (2) an analytical proof found in the appendix (7.1). The result stems from the fact that the TWFE regression is not able to identify off of pixels that are dropped in the first period. Thus the pre-treatment period deforestation rates are not accounted for in the TWFE estimates. 

```{r, fig.cap="Distribution of estimates produced depending on pixel level regression model", fig.pos='H'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/twoway.png")
```

In Figure 4, we see Monte Carlo Outcomes for two econometric model specifications with a binary outcome: (1) DID dropping deforested pixels from the panel for the periods after they are first realized as deforested and (2) TWFE dropping deforested pixels from the panel for the periods after they are first realized as deforested. DID and TWFE regression models are generally identical in the two-group, two-period case, however, we see that in this case, they are drastically different. In both specifications, observations are dropped from the panel in the periods after they are first realized as deforested. As discussed and seen in Appendix (7.1), this is necessary when using the pixel as the unit of analysis. Figure 3 shows, however, that the TWFE model returns a biased measure of the ATT, and in fact, estimates an ex-post single difference. Table 3 shows the resulting bias in the context of the guiding example. 

In our guiding example, the ex-post single difference is 0.01 (the $ATT$ plus the pre-treatment group difference in deforestation rates), which would seem to indicate a increase of 1 percentage point in the deforestation rate due to the intervention, when it actually led to a 1 percentage point decrease in the deforestation rate. Thus, the ex-post single difference as well as the TWFE estimate, is biased positively by 2 percentage points, as evidenced both in Figure 5 and the analytical proof found in the appendix. In the context of our guiding example, this also leads to a change in the direction of the estimated $ATT$, which could influence policymakers to avoid an effective policy design. This shows that TWFE models using the pixel as the unit of analysis are not a viable approach to estimate the $ATT$ in deforestation impact evaluations. In contrast, the DID regression model does not suffer from this severe bias. 

In cases where the researcher has two groups and two distinct time periods, a pixel level analysis is still feasible using the simple DID model. However, when a TWFE model is necessary, the grid-level is a viable substitute for comparable interpretation to the pixel. The grid cell may also offer a solution when there is no clear alternative unit of interest available such as a property or broader administrative unit. 

## Aggregated units of analysis

TWFE models have risen to prominence due to their flexibility in applying DID methods to settings with multiple groups and variation in treatment timing, however, we have shown that TWFE models are not a viable approach to estimate the $ATT$ with the pixel as the unit of analysis in deforestation impact evaluations. Therefore, researchers should be aware of the tradeoffs using aggregated units of analysis. The following results apply to both DID and TWFE regression models, as both are equivalent in the two-period, two-group example. We now opt to use TWFE regression models when aggregating data, and DID regression models for pixel level analyses due to the aforementioned issues with TWFE regressions at the pixel level. 

For simplicity, we assume the researcher can choose between three levels at which to aggregate the data: grid cell, county, and property. Grid cells are uniform grids layered over the study area and may have a treatment value between 0 and 1 following aggregation of pixels. Counties are heterogeneous administrative units at which we now assign the treatment. Lastly, properties are smaller administrative units within a county. 


<!-- Here, include graphic of various administrative units -->

We explore the bias, RMSE, and coverage probabilities corresponding to different levels of aggregation in the context of our guiding example. We find little evidence that any one level of aggregation is consistently preferrable in terms of bias, meaning that RMSE and coverage probability play a larger role as evaluation metrics. Figure 5 shows that the bias of the estimates is not critically different depending on level of aggregation, however, the distributions are varied. RMSE is highest with property level aggregation due to the heterogeneity in property sizes across the landscape. 

Coverage probabilities are impacted by the distribution of the estimates, bias, and standard error structure. We compare coverage at each level of aggregation in Table 2. We have not yet introduced any structure into the DGP that would warrant clustering, so performance is based on classical standard errors. This is demonstrated by coverage probabilities near 95\% with the exception of the pixel level model. When the desired coverage probability is achieved, it is preferable to use models with a lower RMSE.

```

### Property Level Unobservables
Property level unobservables may impact both treatment effect estimates and coverage probabilities. This is likely to be a factor when land use decisions are made at the property level or the intervention seeks to alter underlying landowner incentives. In our Monte Carlo simulations, we vary the error term in the initial DGP, $\rho_v$, at the property level in order to account for these unobservables. We explore the cases when the property level disturbances are generated according to $\rho_v \sim N(0, \sigma_p^2)$ with $\sigma_p = 0.00$, $0.05$, $0.15$, and $0.25$. 

<!-- Implications for bias -->

The introduction of property level unobservables changes the relative performance of each level of aggregation in terms of bias, RMSE, and coverage. We see that pixel level analyses and models with aggregation to the grid cell and county levels suffer from increased bias as the standard error governing the property level disturbances, $\sigma_p$, increases. This is evident in Figure 6. Models with observations aggregated to the property level, however, do not suffer from increased bias after the introduction of property level disturbances. This indicates that aggregating to the level of the relevant decision making unit reduces estimate bias relative to other units of analysis. Further, as property level unobservables play a larger role, pixel level analyses suffer from more bias than any other unit of analysis. 

<!-- Implications for RMSE -->

RMSE is also impacted in the presence of property level unobservables. Figure 6 shows that while RMSE for estimates from property level models remains relatively more stable across values of $\sigma_p$, other models see increased RMSE with higher values of $\sigma_p$. Again, pixel level analyses suffer the most from increased RMSE as property level unobservables become more of a factor. This is partially due to the change in bias.

```

<!-- Implications for coverage -->

Table 3 shows that property level unobservables negatively impact coverage at every level if classical standard errors are used. As property level unobservables play a larger role, the treatment of standard errors also becomes more important. Almost all studies in the literature use clustered standard errors for inference. The clustering problem is caused by the presence of a common unobserved random shock at the group level that will lead to correlation between all observations within a group [@hansen2007]. We have introduced the random shock at the property level in our guiding example to represent individual landowner preferences or property characteristics. As such, correlation within grids and counties will also be introduced, since they contain multiple pixels within a property. Clustering standard errors relaxes the assumption of no correlation across observations within the spatial unit used for clustering [@jones2015]. 

Upon examining Table 3, we see that clustering to the respective level of aggregation does indeed improve the coverage probability in the presence of property level unobservables. Property level aggregation generally leads to preferred coverage probabilities, regardless of the standard error structure. These results highlight the benefit of using the relevant decision-making unit as the unit of analysis as well as clustering standard errors at that level. 

In many instances, researchers do not have access to geospatial boundaries of the relevant decision-making unit. We see in Figure 6 that county and grid cell level aggregation lead to lower levels of bias and RMSE than pixel level specifications when property unobservables are present. County level aggregation leads to the best coverage in the absence of property boundaries, meaning that a larger, alternative administrative unit containing the relevant decision-making units may be the best alternative when an adequate number of observations are available. If a pixel level analysis is used (potentially due to constraints on geospatial boundary access), we see that coverage is greatly improved when standard errors are clustered to a higher level of aggregation such as the coounty.

## Functional Form
Given that all of the outcome metrics used in the studies presented in Table 1 are generated from maps of binary, pixel-level deforestation events, several researchers have suggested that non-linear functional forms may be preferred over linear models. For example, models estimated using individual pixels may be better represented by a probit or logit functional form (XX - Add refs), whereas models that count deforested pixels within a broader unit of observation (i.e. grid cell) may be best modeled using a Poisson distribution [@burgess2012; @busch2015a; @carlson2018]. However, these non-linear functional forms can complicate interpretation of regression coefficients [@gomila2019]. We evaluate whether the use of non-linear functional forms reduce bias in ATT estimates in our setting. We find that, with our DGP, a simple Linear Probability Model (LPM) often results in less bias than alternate, non-linear functional forms. For example, Figure 7 shows the distribution of model bias resulting from different model structures in our guiding parameterization. 

```{r, fig.cap="Distribution of estimates produced by different functional forms. We use DID regression models at the pixel level in this section to avoid the aforementioned issues with pixel level TWFE models. Left: distribution of estimate bias from linear probability model, logit, and probit models with binary unit of analysis; Right: distribution of estimate bias from grid level linear and poisson models", fig.pos='H', fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("figs/func1.png", "figs/func_agg.png"))
```

We also explore how functional form choice may depend on the deforestation rates in a given setting, since functional form choice may have more of an impact in low event probability scenarios [XX - find refs]. Figure 8 explores how bias behaves as a function of the magnitude of our initial parameters. Here, we scale the set of initial parameters, while keeping their relative magnitudes the same. We see that the linear DID models consistently outperform the non-linear functional form DID models with low deforestation rates. When deforestation rates become high, we see that the non-linear models begin to outperform the linear DID model, however it is unlikely to encounter a setting with deforestation rates this high. For reference, the linear DID still outperforms the nonlinear models when the parameter set is three times as large as the guiding example, where the baseline deforestation rate in the intervention area is 15/% and the $ATT$ is equivalent to a reduction in the deforestation rate by 3 percentage points.

<!-- Does it make sense to start at 1 and increase from there? Current plot draws a lot of attention to the volatility as you approach 0 - is that actually an important consideration, or do we want people to focus on the fact that there's an increasing trend-line for many of the variables?

Albert: the results indicate that we want to focus on the trend line, however, I think it might be important to see what is happening with low deforestation rates, since people might expect that to be an instance when functional form is important. It's also a more likely scenario than extremely high deforestation rates. 
-->

The underlying DGP and error structure play a role in determining which functional form leads to the least bias in a given scenario. Alternative parameterizations may affect which functional form is optimal in a given circumstance. Further, one can imagine a slightly different DGP in which the preferred functional form is different than in our setup. Therefore, authors, regardless of the preferred specification, should justify their choice, taking into account the data structure underlying their specific context. We also recommend that authors ensure the result is robust to alternate functional forms.

One idea for a nice summary figure: I wonder if it's possible to create a variant of Ariel Ortiz-Boboa's regression specification chart to display all of the above models at once (https://twitter.com/arielortizbobea/status/1237518566598963200?lang=en)
Imagine the boxes representing the bias distribution for each econometric model specification, the bottom boxplot illustrating deviation from 95% confidence interval, and the table below highlighting the specifications. This could be an amazing way to summarize the results of any model specification in one figure for the eventual shiny app. It'd also allow us to compare how sensitive our results are to different parametrizations.

# Discussion

This paper seeks to leave researchers with a clear sense of the decisions that play a role in their choice of econometric specification. Despite past guidance to the contrary, models that incorporate fixed effects for individual points are unable to yield unbiased estimates of a policy's ATT when applied to irreversible, binary observations of deforestation. This is due to the fact that when pixels are dropped after they first become deforested (necessary in the case of an irreversible binary outcome as shown in Appendix 7.1), TWFE models cannot identify off of points deforested in the first period. We explore the benefits of conducting the analysis at the level of the relevant decision making unit and offer guidance for when it is not relevant or available. Choice of functional form should be justified in the context of each institutional setting, and robustness checks should account for the possibility of alternative functional forms and spatial autocorrelation. Ultimately, context plays a role in all of these decisions. There is no one size fits all econometric specification, and researchers should make clear which decisions they have made as well as their reasoning. We have developed a shiny app available at .. so that researchers can evaluate the potential tradeoffs with choices of econometric model design in their own setting.  

<!-- Still need to do some work to discuss up and coming literature regarding use of satellite data for impact evaluation. measurement, classification error, etc. -->

<!-- The result stems from the fact that the TWFE regression is not able to identify off of pixels that are dropped in the first period. Thus the pre-treatment period deforestation rates are not accounted for in the TWFE estimates.  -->


An up and coming literature explores how remotely sensed data may need special consideration when used in impact evaluation. Aspects of the collection process such as satellite sensor characteristics, atmospheric conditions, and image processing may influence the structure of remotely sensed data products [@jain2020; @alix-garcia2020]. Of particular concern is the propensity for non-classical measurement error, which can lead to biased estimates of the $ATT$ [@wooldridge]. @alix-garcia2020 propose a solution for the case of a remotely sensed binary outcome in which misclassification is non-classical. As the proliferation of research relying on satellite data continues, researchers will need consider the intricacies of particular satellite data sources in order to substantiate causal claims. 

Several econometric considerations relevant to model design and interpretation were not explored in this paper. TWFE regression models have received substantial attention in the econometrics literature recently, regarding concerns surrounding their viability and interpretability [e.g. @kropko2020]. For example, properties of TWFE regression models that arise when the treatment effect is heterogeneous across groups or over time may lead to erroneous results [@deChaisemartin2019]. We largely abstract away from choices of scale with regards to grid size or unit of analysis, but biased estimates may result from scale choices that are too large or too small relative to the data generating process or decision unit [@avelino2016]. This makes choice of grid cell size a relevant but unexplored aspect of our study. Lastly, the benefits of pre-matching control and treatment units are not addressed, but they are well understood to be substantial [e.g. @jones2015; @blackman2013]. 

Without clear guidance on key econometric model design decisions, a wide variety of methods have been used in the literature using quasi-experimental methods for conservation impact evaluation. We show that a number of studies likely provide estimates that suffer from bias or improper inference. In particular, our result about the use of TWFE models with the pixel as the relevant unit of analysis casts doubt as to the reliability of a significant number of estimates. This said, a significant number of studies have displayed proper intuition in the design of the econometric model. The increasingly widespread awareness of methods of causal inference is a further positive step. The observations made here may apply to a wider audience beyond the set of researchers investigating the impacts of conservation interventions on deforestation. Any evaluation of interventions implemented at a spatial scale may benefit from this discussion. These results further apply to many settings in which the outcome represents an irreversible binary event. For example, studies addressing technology adoption as an outcome may fall prey to the same issues we describe with a pixel level analysis. Moving forward, it is imperative that researchers use methods that minimize bias and allow inference at expected levels of confidence. Misleading results may lead policymakers to avoid impactful policy designs or adopt policy that worsens environmental damages.

## Two-way fixed effects proof

In settings with a binary and unrepeatable outcome variable, the commonly used pixel level TWFE model yields the post-treatment difference in outcomes (single difference), rather than the desired estimand (average treatment effect on the treated).

proof:

Consider a two-period setting $(t=1,2)$ with multiple pixels indexed by $i$. We observe $y_{it}$, the realized deforestation occurring in each pixel in each time period. Some units are exposed to a policy treatment in the second time period $(w_{i,2}=1)$. Using the potential outcomes framework, we consider the potential outcomes for each observation as $y_{i,2}(w_{i,2})$. In this notation, the treatment effect for unit $i$ can be defined as

$$\tau_i = y_{i,2}(1) - y_{i,2}(0) $$

<!-- We are interested in estimating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), which can be defined as: -->

In many deforestation maps generated through remote sensing, deforestation is represented as a binary indicator. Furthermore, deforestation is only observed once for a given location since these data products typically do not monitor the timing of reforestation. Given these constraints, deforestation is typically (@alix-garciaandgibbs2017; @jones2015) represented as a binary, unrepeatable variable taking the following values: 

$$ y_{i1}=\alpha+\tau w_{i1}+c_i+u_{i1}$$
\[y_{it}= \begin{cases} 
      0 & \text{the pixel has never been deforested}\\
      1 & \text{the pixel was deforested in year }t\\
      NAN & \text{the pixel was deforested in a year }<t\\
   \end{cases}
\]

The traditional two-way fixed effects model seeks to estimate this effect using the following regression specification:

$$ y_{it}=\alpha+\beta w_{it}+\gamma_i+\eta_t+u_{it}, \text{ for } t=1,2 $$

Taking into account the data structure of $y_{it}$ and our two-period case, we are left with:

$$ y_{i1}=\alpha+\gamma_i+u_{i1}$$

and

\[y_{i2}= \begin{cases} 
      \alpha+\beta w_{i2}+\gamma_i+\eta_{t=2} + u_{i2} & y_{i1}= 0\\
      NAN & y_{i1} \neq 0 
   \end{cases}
\]


First differencing,

\[y_{i2}-y_{i1}= \begin{cases} 
      (\alpha+\beta w_{i2}+\gamma_i+\eta_{t=2} + u_{i2}) - (\alpha+\gamma_i+u_{i1}) & y_{i1}= 0\\
      NAN & y_{i1} \neq 0 
   \end{cases}
\]


Consider the regression
$$ y_{it}=\alpha+\eta d2_t+\tau w_{it}+c_i+u_{it}, \text{ for } t=1,2 $$


 Focusing on the first case, where $y_{i1}=0$
\begin{align*}
(\alpha+\beta w_{i2}+\gamma_i+\eta_{t=2} + u_{i2}) - (\alpha+\gamma_i+u_{i1})\\
&=\beta w_{i2} + \eta_{t=2} + \Delta u_{i}
\end{align*}


The general expression can be restated as:

\[y_{i2}-y_{i1}= \begin{cases} 
 \beta w_{i2} + \eta_{t=2} + \Delta u_{i} & y_{i1}= 0\\
      NAN & y_{i1} \neq 0 
   \end{cases}
\]

With binary treatment ($w_{it}$), $\hat{\beta}$, the regression’s estimate of $\beta$ can be expressed as the double difference in mean outcomes across treated / untreated units, and across the two time periods:


\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta}&= \frac{1}{n_{ST}}\sum_{i:w_i=1} y_{i2} - \frac{1}{n_{ST}}\sum_{i:w_i=1} y_{i1} - (\frac{1}{n_{SU}}\sum_{i:w_i=0} y_{i2} - \frac{1}{n_{SU}}\sum_{i:w_i=0} y_{i1})
\end{align*}

, where $n_{ST}$ and $n_{SU}$ are the number of surviving treated and untreated units such that $y_{i1}=0$, respectively. 

Since this captures where $y_{i1}=0$, we have $\frac{1}{n_{ST}}\sum_{i:w_i=1} y_{i1}=0$ and $\frac{1}{n_{SU}}\sum_{i:w_i=0} y_{i1}=0$ 

Then restating the expression:   

\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta}&= \frac{1}{n_{ST}}\sum_{i:w_i=1} y_{i2} - 0 - (\frac{1}{n_{SU}}\sum_{i:w_i=0} y_{i2} - 0)\\
\end{align*}

Applying the potential outcomes to indicate whether we see the treated or untreated outcome:
\begin{align*}
&= \frac{1}{n_{ST}}\sum_{i:w_i=1} y_{i2}(1) - \frac{1}{n_{SU}}\sum_{i:w_i=0} y_{i2}(0)\\
\end{align*}

Finally, adding and subtracting $\frac{1}{n_{ST}}\sum_{i:w_i=1} y_{i2}(0)$ gives:
\begin{align*}
&=    \frac{1}{n_{ST}}\sum_{i:w_i=1} y_{i2}(1) - y_{i2}(0)  \\
+& \frac{1}{n_{ST}}\sum_{i:w_i=1}y_{i2}(0) - \frac{1}{n_{SU}}\sum_{i:w_i=0} y_{i2}(0) \\
&= ATT+Diff\\
\blacksquare &
\end{align*}

## Demonstration that dropping pixels in periods after they are first deforested is necessary

Remotely sensed metrics of deforestation at the pixel level are often subject to the dynamics of forest disturbance and regrowth. After a deforestation event occurs, the deforested area is unlikely to revert to forest cover within the study period, as it takes several years for forest to regenerate to a detectable level. In the panel therefore, it is probable that in the periods after a pixel is first realized as deforested, subsequent observations of the pixel will also observe the pixel as deforested. 

The logic for dropping binary pixels after they first become deforested is as follows. A forested pixel switches from its assigned value of 0 to a value of 1 following a discrete deforestation event. Keeping the deforested pixel in the panel beyond the first period in which it was observed as deforested may imply that it has actively been deforested in each subsequent time period. In fact, no new deforestation event has ocurred, but the area simply remains deforested from the prior event. These pixels, therefore, contribute positively towards the deforestation rate in each period they are left in the panel.

### Analytical expression of bias in two-period two-group case when pixels are not dropped from the panel

The DID estimand is
\begin{align*}
& E[y_{it} |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1] - E[y_{it} |  t<t_0, D_i=1] - (E[y_{it} |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0] - E[y_{it} |  t<t_0, D_i=0] )\\
=& P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1) - P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) - \\
& (P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0) - P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0) )
\end{align*}

In the case of an irreversible binary outcome, the first and third terms can be reexpressed, giving
\begin{align*}
& P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1)\cup P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) - P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) - \\
 & (P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0)\cup P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0) - P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0) ) \\
=& P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1) + P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) -P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1)\cap P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) -\\
& P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) -\\
& (P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0) + P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0) - P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0)\cap P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0) - \\
& P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0) )\\
=& P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1) -P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1)\cap P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) -\\
& (P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0) - P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0)\cap P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0))
\end{align*}

We can attempt to sign the bias introduced here. The bias will be positive when
\begin{align*}
&P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1) -P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1)\cap P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) -\\
& (P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0) - P(y_{it}=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0)\cap P(y_{it}=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0))\\
\geq & ATT\\
\Leftrightarrow \\
&P(y_{it}(1)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1) -P(y_{it}(1)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1)\cap P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) -\\
& (P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0) - P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0)\cap P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0))\\
\geq & P(y_{it}(1) = 1 | t\geq t_0, D_i=1) - P(y_{it}(0) = 1 | t\geq t_0, D_i=1)\\
\Leftrightarrow \\
& P(y_{it}(0) = 1 | t\geq t_0, D_i=1)-P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0)\\
\geq & P(y_{it}(1)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1)\cap P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) - P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0)\cap P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0)\\
\end{align*}

While it is not possible to sign the bias, it will be positive when:
\begin{align*}
P(y_{it}(0) = 1 | t\geq t_0, D_i=1) \geq P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0)
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
P(y_{it}(1)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1) \geq P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0)
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=1) \geq P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0)
\end{align*}

Thus, under parallel trends, if the deforestation rate is higher in the treatment group both before and after treatment, the bias will be positive (and vice versa). 

### Monte Carlo evidence

Figure XX demonstrates the magnitude and direction of the bias incurred from keeping deforested pixels in the panel after they are first realized as deforested in the context of our guiding example. Pixels that were deforested prior to the implementation of the policy continued to contribute to the deforestation rate in the post period in both the treatment and control groups. Dropping the pixels in the periods after they are first observed as deforested mitigates this bias in the DID model, as seen in Figure XX. 


<!-- If the main point of this figure is to contrast the bias in the two examples here, I'd suggest forcing the x-axes to stay constant across figures. Maybe just easier to drop them both on the same plot? -->
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="75%", fig.cap="Distribution of DID estimates leaving deforested pixels in the panel and of DID estimates dropping deforested pixels. Note that leaving deforested pixels in the panel incurs severe bias.", fig.pos = 'H', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/did_keep.png")
```

While dropping pixels in the periods after they first become cleared does generate a small amount of bias, this is inherent to the nature of binary forest cover data. Dropping these observations allows the researcher to attain estimates with bias much closer to zero than would be possible keeping them in the panel. This bias is unrelated to that which may arise from satellite sensor characteristics, satellite angle, or atmospheric conditions [@jain2020].

## Initial Monte Carlo parameter to $\beta$ coefficient mapping

The researcher sets the following four parameters:

\begin{align*}
baseline_0 &= E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=0]\\
baseline_1 &= E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=1]\\
trend_0 &= E[y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0] - E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=0]\\
trend_1 &= E[y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1] - E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=1]\\
ATT &= E[y_{it}(1) - y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1]\\
\end{align*}

Note the following constraints on the parameters:
\begin{align*}
E[y_{it}(0) |  t \geq t_0, D_i=0] \geq 0\\
E[y_{it}(1) |  t \geq t_0, D_i=1] \geq 0
\end{align*}

The parameters can be expressed as follows:

\begin{align*}
ATT =& E[y_{it}(1) - y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1] \\
=& E[ y_{it}(1) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1] - E[y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1]\\
=& P(y_{it}(1) = 1 | t\geq t_0, D_i=1) - P(y_{it}(0) = 1 | t\geq t_0, D_i=1)\\
=& P(y_{it}^* (1) >0 | t\geq t_0, D_i=1) - P(y_{it}^*(0) >0 | t\geq t_0, D_i=1)\\
=& P(\beta_0 + \beta_1 +\beta_2 +\beta_3 + \alpha_i +u_{it} > 0) - P(\beta_0 + \beta_1 +\beta_2 + \alpha_i +u_{it} > 0)\\
=& P(-\alpha_i -u_{it} < \beta_0 + \beta_1 +\beta_2 +\beta_3) - P(-\alpha_i -u_{it} < \beta_0 + \beta_1 +\beta_2)\\
=& F(\beta_0 + \beta_1 +\beta_2 +\beta_3) - F(\beta_0 + \beta_1 +\beta_2)
\end{align*}


\begin{align*}
trend_0 =& E[y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0] - E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=0]\\
=& P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t\geq t_0, D_i=0) - P(y_{it}(0)=1 |  t<t_0, D_i=0)\\
=& P(y^*_{it}(0)>0 |  t \geq t_0, D_i=0) - P(y^*_{it}(0)>0 |  t<t_0, D_i=0)\\
=& P(-\alpha_i -u_{it} < \beta_0 +\beta_{2,0}) - P(-\alpha_i -u_{it} < \beta_0 )\\
=& F(\beta_0 + \beta_{2,0}) - F(\beta_0)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
trend_1 =& E[y_{it}(0) |  t\geq t_0, D_i=1] - E[y_{it}(0) |  t<t_0, D_i=1]\\

## Relevant discussion of key model parameterizations in the literature

### Unit of Analysis

The pixel and grid level analyses provide a landscape scale interpretation for the results, which may be beneficial when no clear alternative unit of interest exists. For example, @anderson2018 explore how overlapping land allocations impact deforestation. Here, the estimated effect from a pixel-level analysis is more intuitive than would be generated from an "overlap" level analysis, where the coefficient could be interpreted as the average effect on a representative "overlap". 

Pixel level analyses often times require the researcher to sample points in the interest of computational feasibility [e.g. @alix-garcia2018; @anderson2018]. In our paper, we do not consider the impact this may have on the analysis. Sampling pixels from the landscape may ignore important spatial dependencies or relationships that would be captured with aggregation. Some papers, as a result, choose to aggregate pixels to the grid level. This maintains the landscape-scale interpretation provided by pixel level analyses, while allowing the author to include every pixel in the analysis within a manageable number of grid cells. In exchange for fine-scale spatial specificity, using coarser-resolution cells rather than pixels has the benefits of diluting the effects of possible spatial misalignments between datasets, enabling easier interpolation of missing data within cells, and subsuming localized spatial correlation [@busch2015a]. Although not necessarily an issue, one consideration of using grid cell aggregation is the potential for the grid cell to overlap two or more administrative units. In this case, the treatment variable will be continuous, or the researcher must make a decision as to how treatment should be represented. 

Property level analyses have been promoted in the context of PES programs, but some researchers have avoided them due to interpretability in certain situations. The interpretation on the treatment effect coefficient is the average effect on a property with average characteristics [@alix-garcia2017]. The effect of the intervention on a landowner's land use decisions is likely what the researcher is after when evaluating PES program, however, this measure may be less directly related to the success of a landscape-scale intervention. If a property does not have an easily attributable first date of treatment because of shifts or overlaps in boundaries over time, it may also not be an easy unit of analysis to work with. 

Some researchers choose to use a larger administrative boundary as the unit of analysis such as the state, municipality, or county in order to address the level at which the intervention is applied. Again, this may mitigate concerns over bias emerging from local spillovers within an administrative unit [@sims2017]. Although this does not apply to general equilibrium leakage due to price responses or changes in relative profitability [@arriagada2012], this may offer one advantage to using administrative or property boundaries relative to a pixel or grid level analysis.  



### Calculating deforestation rates

Upon choosing an aggregated unit of analysis, the researcher must compute the deforestaion rate. This varies thoughout the literature, and many authors do not explicitly define the formula used. Different names are used to describe the calculation of the annual deforestation rate, which generates further confusion [@puyravaud2003]. We test the performance of three common deforestation rate formulas in the literature. 

One common formula to calculate annual deforestation rates is
\begin{align}
\text{Outcome 1)} &= \frac{F_{i,t-1} - F_{it}}{F_{i,t-1}}
\end{align}
, where $F_{it}$ and $F_{i,t-1}$ are the forest cover at times $t$ and $t-1$, respectively. This calculation is used consistently in the literature [e.g. @carlson2018; @busch2015a], and is arguably the most widely used formula. Some authors have also calculated the deforestation rate in relation to the initial observed level of forest cover, replacing $F_{it}$ with $F_{i0}$, the baseline forest cover, in equation (1). This gives outcome 2):
\begin{align}
\text{Outcome 2)} &= \frac{F_{i0} - F_{it}}{F_{i0}}
\end{align}
<!-- Are there any examples in which people used this formula in the literature? -->

Lastly, we consider a formula derived from the Compound Interest Law that has also been used in recent studies [e.g. @ruggiero2019, @purvayaud2003]. Outcome 3) is given by:

\begin{align}
\text{Outcome 3)} &= ln(F_{i,t-1}/F_{it})
\end{align}

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="75%", fig.cap="Distribution of estimates produced by different outcome variable formulae", fig.pos='H', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/outcome.png")
```

Figure 8 demonstrates that outcome 1 results in the least bias in our guiding example. The other outcomes result in relatively greater bias, although this difference seems minimal in our setting. RMSE is also comparable across the three outcomes. 

We express concern surrounding the use of the initial observed baseline forest cover in the calculation of deforestation rates, as in formula (2). As the rate is calculated in periods further away from the baseline, the deforestation rate will be increasingly high, even if the rate has not changed over time. We demonstrate this issue in Figure XX by examining how bias behaves as a function of the length of study period. Formula (2) is indeed the least robust to changes in the length of study period. We set $trend =0$ and $ATT=0$ to show a basic case where the intervention had no effect and deforestation rates in the treated and untreated group are stable though time.

Regardless of authors' choice of formula, we advise that this formula be explicitly stated in the paper. This will help to avoid confusion as to which formula was used and help researchers understand which methods are the standard within the literature. Moving forward in our paper, all specifications using aggregated data use outcome 1. In our guiding example, it resulted in the least bias and lowest RMSE, and it is currently the most common deforestation rate calculation used in the literature. 

Here, we show that outcome formula 2) is problematic in our context. We examine the performance of the three outcomes in an example where $ATT=0$ and $trend=0$. This simple exercise allows us to gauge how the outcomes behave through time. As we see below, outcome 2) is the least robust to changes in the study period length, while outcomes 1) and 2) behave nearly identically. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.cap="Bias as a function of study period length with ATT =0 and no time trend", fig.pos='H', fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("figs/outcome_byyr1.png")#, "figs/outcome_byyr2.png"))

```

### Functional form

Some authors do justify their use of funtional form based on the structure of observed data. In many cases, the distribution of observed data is nonnegative and concentrated near zero deforestation [@carlson2018; @busch2015a]. @busch2015a argues a poisson model is theoretically consistent with forest cover loss within an aggregated unit being the count of many independent, discrete binary observations of forest cover loss at the pixel level. 

While non-linear functional forms may be theoretically preferable to OLS, this is often times more complicated to implement in practice. In order to obtain an interpretable estimate of the $ATT$, researchers using non-linear functional forms generally need to compute marginal or average partial effects from the estimated coefficients. It has been noted in the impact evaluation literature that fixed effects cannot typically be used in most non-linear methods due to the incidental parameters problem [e.g. @jones2015; @wendland2015], favoring the use of OLS in regression models containing fixed effects. @fernandez-val2016 show that a bias correction is needed to get asymptotically unbiased estimates logit, probit, and poisson TWFE models. These bias corrections are available in various statistical packages and are necessary in order to get unbiased estimates when using fixed effects with non-linear functional forms. 

In our paper, coefficient estimates are converted into the $ATT$ using the \textbf{mfx} package in R, which takes into account the binary nature of the treatment variable.
