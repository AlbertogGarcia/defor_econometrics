This generates confusion. I suggest that the annual rate of change of forest cover should be calculated as: r  1=t2 À t1 Â lnA2=A1. This formula is derived from the Compound Interest Law. It is also derived from the mean annual rate of change and for this reason, is more intuitive than the formula used by FAO [q  A2=A11=t2Àt1 À 1]. The rate r is always higher than q, but in most cases, the difference between the two quantities is lower than the sampling error. The rate r is signi®cantly higher than q only when deforestation is extremely high. To ease comparisons between sites of annual rates of forest change, the forest area, time of measurements and formulae used should be clearly indicated.},

This rapid deforestation has dramatically changed the chemical composition of the world’s atmosphere, the level of biodiversity, and the presence of vegetation key to maintaining watershed function and preventing landslides. There has been a boom in the design of local and international policy instruments to prevent further deforestation and to encourage forest growth. This article reviews the theory and evidence surrounding forest-related payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes intended to slow and reverse deforestation. We cover the most recent work touching on a range of issues related to PES programs, including research on targeting, contract design, environmental effectiveness, challenges to program implementation, spillovers, and distributional considerations of conditional cash transfers. We also highlight areas of potential future research.},

However, limitations of traditional land cover classiﬁcations are numerous and well known. This research compares classiﬁcation-based techniques (discrete data) to the use of vegetation indices (continuous data) for land cover modeling and analyses of landscape fragmentation for a study area in western Honduras. The study area typiﬁes many regions of tropical developing countries, where a complex interaction of social and environmental factors have given rise to a dynamic mosaic of patches of reforestation and deforestation. Understanding the complex human dimensions of land use and land cover change in these parts of the world continues to present a challenge for researchers.},
